This is the README for our Friday Project 7. 

The file, when run, will show a pop up window that will let the user either click on "Show Sign Up" or "Show Sign In".

Show sign up will pull up with a couple of boxes that will prompt the user for an email and a password to confirm their password. 
Once that is completed, the user will click sign up which will redirect them to the previous pop up window.

Show sign in will ask the user for the email and password that was just created.
If entered in correctly, a pop up will display saying that the log in was succesful, otherwise a pop up will display saying that the information entered was incorrect.
